# Desktop-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe with GUI
The first project was a Desktop Tic-Tac-Toe game, which I developed using the Java Swing library and the Minimax algorithm. I implemented multithreading to improve the game's speed and designed the code for abstraction, stability, and reuse. This project helped me develop my object-oriented programming skills and taught me the importance of efficient algorithms.
